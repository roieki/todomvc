In addition, we have a core project team composed of:</p>\n<h4><a href=\"http://github.com/addyosmani\">Addy Osmani</a> - Founder/Lead</h4>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/96270e4c3e5e9806cf7245475c00b275.png?s=40\">\n  Addy is a Software Engineer at Google who originally created TodoMVC.

Whilst we hope that this project is able to offer assistance in deciding what frameworks are worth spending more time looking at, remember that the Todo application offers a limited view of what a framework may be capable of.</p>\n<p>It is meant to be used as a gateway to reviewing how a basic application using a framework may be structured and we heavily recommend investing time researching a solution in more depth before opting to use it.</p>\n<p>Also, please keep in mind that TodoMVC is not the perfect way to compare the size of different frameworks. We intentionally use the unminified versions to make reading the source code easier.</p>\n<h2>Getting Involved</h2>\n<p>Whilst we enjoy implementing and improving existing Todo apps, we&apos;re always interested in speaking to framework authors (and users) wishing to share Todo app implementations in their framework/solution of choice.</p>\n<p>Check out our <a href=\"contributing.md\">contribution docs</a> for more info.</p>\n<h2>License</h2>\n<p>Everything in this repo is MIT License unless otherwise specified.</p>\n<p>MIT &#xA9; Addy Osmani, Sindre Sorhus, Pascal Hartig, Stephen Sawchuk.</p>\n"
